            <div><p> </p><p>A whole note is held for 4 beats (quarter notes).</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: In the video below, there is no instrument actually playing or holding this whole note. Regan is simply using her finger to show the difference between the timing of a whole note vs. a quarter note.</p><p> </p><p>A Half Note is held for 2 beats (quarter notes)</p><p> </p><p>An eighth note is half a beat (quarter note). These are often referred to as “syncopations”</p><p> </p><p>This is the rhythm played by the bass guitar (bajo), creating the soul of the song.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: it’s very hard to hear the low sound of the bass guitar in this video. Play a bachata song on a good sound system to listen for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7_-sNrzEHl0?t=1:00" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Check out this video clip</a> to hear what the bass sounds like and watch this rhythm being played, so you can begin identifying it.</p><p> </p></div>
