            <div><p>Body movement and isolations are so versatile and small changes can make something look totally different.</p><p>Let’s take the dipping and body roll concepts you’ve learned and add some level changes to them.</p><p>Of course, this is just the beginning. We totally encourage you to explore and try out variations of your own making. Every song is different and the dip or movement that worked great to one song might feel better if you change it slightly for another song. Think: speed/timing, angles and levels.</p><p>Learn, practice, explore and have fun with it!</p><p><strong>Moves you should already know for this lesson</strong>:</p><p> </p><p>La música: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmd8CcpiIBo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stay – Rihanna (DJ Soltrix Bachata Remix)</a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
