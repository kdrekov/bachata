            <div><p>Ok Guys, now that you’re improving how you step and move your hips and torso, here are a few options to style your arms in your various basics.</p><p>Men tend not to need to style their arms much during social dancing, but if it feels right with the music go for it! And if you perform or compete, these options can be a great addition to your choreographies.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: styling is an aesthetic extension of body movement. It all starts with your steps and weight shifts. From there your movement comes through your core and outward towards your arms. “Styling” will only look natural and good when layered on top of quality body movement. If you find yourself struggling, focus on creating a strong foundation of movement first (steps, weight shifts, hips and chest) and then add these aesthetic touches.</p><p> </p><p>La música: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOy4siyFp0U" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Romeo Santos, Raulin Rodriguez – La Demanda</a></p><p> </p><p>Note: ensure your movement matches the music. It doesn’t make sense to do a sharp/strong movement to a relaxed part of a song, but it will look great if you place it in a more energetic part.</p><p> </p><p>(Please excuse the small audio issue in this video :)</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
