<h1>Mindset Pillar 5: Self Awareness (3 Levels)</h1>
<a href="bachata-secrets-to-success.html">⬅️ Назад</a>
<div><p>These are three levels of awareness you want to reflect on and cultivate:</p><p>This is your core beliefs and values: WHY you do what you do and WHY you want the things you want.</p><p>This is your habits and behaviours: HOW you approach something.</p><p>This is your goals and desires: WHAT you want.</p><p>Reflect on each of these for yourself to become more aware. You can’t change or improve something until you’re aware of it.</p><p>You can’t self-correct and adjust course until you know where the problem lies.</p></div>
<h3>1. WHY (Identity)</h3>
