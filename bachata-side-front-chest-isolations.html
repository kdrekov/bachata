<div><p>Beginner Level 3 is all about body movement. Body movement is what makes dancing so captivating, and it’s also one of the trickier aspects of learning to dance, so we want to get you started early.</p><p>It takes time, so relax and enjoy the process! Just try and make today a little better than yesterday.</p><p>We’ll start by teaching you how to begin isolating and controlling your own body movements, and then we’ll move on to how to lead and follow those movements with your partners.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
