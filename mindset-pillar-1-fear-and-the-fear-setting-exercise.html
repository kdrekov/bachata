            <div><p>Now we’re going to start covering the five pillars of mindset that, if practiced, will help you achieve more fulfillment in your dancing and in life.</p><p>Cultivating these pillars will make you a more effective human, saving you time, stress and enhancing your chances of success – at becoming the person (or dancer) you most want to be, and doing the things you most want to do.</p><p> </p><p>Fear most often comes from fear of the unknown, so reduce the unknown and visualize everything that could go wrong.</p><p>Choose an action or decision you’re afraid to make and ask yourself “What is the worst thing that could happen? What would the consequences be?”</p><p><em>Column 1: Define</em> – write down the worse case scenario and every bad thing you can think of that might happen</p><p><em>Column 2: Prevent</em> – what could you do to prevent or reduce the chance of each thing happening?</p><p><em>Column 3: Repair</em> – what could you do to repair the damage or who could you ask for help?</p><p>What might be the benefits or even a partial success? Consider them all. Take 10 minutes.</p><p>Make three columns and label them: 6 months, 12 months and 3 years.</p><p>Ask yourself: what will happen if I let fear win and avoid this action/decision? What might my life look like in 6 months, 12 months and 3 years?</p><p>Take it all in, and weigh the pros and cons of your action or decision.</p>
