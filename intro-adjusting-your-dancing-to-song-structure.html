Let’s talk about how to get there.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Understand the ideas in this lesson</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Listen to bachata music, get a feel for it’s structure and listen for how patterns repeat in the song (to help you find those hits, pauses and playful moments).</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Practice on the dance floor!</p><p> </p><p>We covered <a href="/modules/bachata-intermediate-level-2/lessons/bachata-song-structure/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bachata Song Structure</a> in the first lesson of this level so, if you missed it go check it out now!
