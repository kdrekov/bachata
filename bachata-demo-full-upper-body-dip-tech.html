            <div><p>Now that you’re getting the idea of how to dip, we’re going to go a little deeper, literally.</p><p>Keep in mind that dips aren’t a part of traditional bachata. They were added as the dance developed and become more commercialized.</p><p>The first dip is the waterfall and it’s straight back. The second dip is more circular and has a Zouk feel to it. Many of the “sensual bachata” moves you see are borrowed from Brazilian Zouk.</p><p>Follows, don’t forget to support yourselves and, leads, take care of your follow!</p><p>La música: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mL2XaAFehEQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Me Soltaste – Jesse &amp; Joy (DJ Alejandro Bachata Remix)</a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
