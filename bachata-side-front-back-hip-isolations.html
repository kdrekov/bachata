<h1>Side to Side &amp; Front to Back Hip Isolations</h1>

<div><p>Next up it’s hip isolations. Don’t get frustrated if you don’t get them right away. This is literally a game of repetition as your brain learns how to make new neuromuscular connections (the connections between your brain and muscle tissues).</p><p>The more you practice these isolations the quicker your brain will develop the ability to accurately send signals to your muscles and control them as you desire. </p><p>Find a mirror or film yourself!<br/>
